## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

ImaLink follows a clean layered architecture:

```
API Layer (FastAPI)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Repository Layer (Data Access)
    ↓
Models (SQLAlchemy ORM)
    ↓
PostgreSQL Database
```

### Key Concepts

**Photo vs ImageFile:**
- `Photo` = The visual subject/moment (what users see)
- `ImageFile` = Physical file on disk (can have multiple per photo)
- Photos are identified by `hothash` (SHA256 of 150x150 thumbnail)

**Visibility System (Phase 1):**
- `private` - Owner only (default)
- `space` - Space members (Phase 2 - not yet functional)
- `authenticated` - All logged-in users
- `public` - Everyone including anonymous

**Author System:**
- Authors are **shared metadata tags** (not user-scoped)
- Used to identify who took a photo
- Photo ownership via `Photo.user_id`, not Author
- All users can view all authors

**User Ownership:**
- Most resources owned by users: `Photo.user_id`, `ImageFile.user_id`, etc.
- Complete data isolation between users
- Exception: Authors (shared metadata)
